## Cameron Whitehead

My name is Cameron Whitehead and I'm a highly analytical and driven student programmer with a first in an MMath from the University of Oxford. I've previously worked in financial services and HM Treasury, and I'm now looking for a job where I can use what I've learned at Makers Academy to solve interesting problems and work with interesting people.

## Experience

**Mako Global Derivatives** (Nov 2017 - Jun 2018)    
*Trainee trader* 
- I worked on the Short Term Interest Rates options desk.
- I proactively developed several products for the desk to improve our efficiency (e.g. an automatic alert when liquidity dropped for selected securities). For this I almost exclusively used Python and was entirely self-directed. 
- I also used TensorFlow to write an AI which would decide whether to hold a security or not but, unsurprisingly, it was not particularly accurate. 

**HM Treasury** (Apr 2017 - Nov 2017)
*Policy Adviser*
- My role was in the Financial Services group on EU strategy, responsible for Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories market access policy.
- I also project managed 12 cross-cutting work streams across the Financial Services group.

**Universit√§t Stuttgart** (Jun 2015 - Aug 2015)
*Research Assistant*
- Recieved funding to work on an original problem related to the representation theory of orthogonal groups. Solved it by the end of my time in Stuttgart.
