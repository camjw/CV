# Cameron Whitehead

My name is Cameron Whitehead and I'm a highly analytical and driven student programmer with a first in an MMath from the University of Oxford. I've previously worked in financial services and at HM Treasury, and I'm now looking for a job where I can use what I've learned at Makers Academy to solve interesting problems and work with interesting people. 


## Selected projects 

| Project | Description | 
|---|---|
| [Connect Four](https://github.com/camjw/connect_four)  | A Connect Four game I wrote before starting Makers, which I later went updated with unit tests and implemented Travis CI.  |

## Skills

#### Strong communicating

- While at HM Treasury I was responsible for drafting advice to ministers and senior officials, correspondence to foreign heads of state, and FOIs from members of the public.
- I recieved firsts for an extended essay and dissertation I wrote in my third and fourth year of university, respectively.
- In my previous role I was required to communicate complex, financially sensitive information quickly over the phone to brokers who may not have English as a first language.


#### Self directed learning

- I took the initiative to learn VBA at HM Treasury and used this to automate project management work for my department. This saved approximately a days worth of work a week and produced a higher quality document than previous methods.
- I also learned some Python, particularly the Pandas package, while working in financial services, just by following online courses. I used this to create better analytical reports faster.
- Before starting at Makers I wrote a simple connect four game in Ruby, which can be found [here](https://github.com/camjw/connect_four).


#### Analytical thinking

- Enjoy solving abstract problems, which I did extensively in my degree, and hope to do more of this in the future.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (Sep 2018 to Dec 2018)

I recieved a fellowship to Makers Academy, which is a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp focussing on:

- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine, Git

#### University of Oxford (Sep 2012 - Jun 2016)

- Studied Mathematics and took mostly algebra modules.
- Received first class honours for BA and MMath in Mathematics and graduated in the top ten of my year. I was offered a funded D.Phil place. 
- In my fourth year I wrote a dissertation for which I recieved a first. 


## Experience

**Mako Global Derivatives** (Nov 2017 - Jun 2018)    
*Trainee trader* 
- I worked on the Short Term Interest Rates options desk.
- I proactively developed several products for the desk to improve our efficiency (e.g. an automatic alert when liquidity dropped for selected securities). For this I almost exclusively used Python and was entirely self-directed. 
- I also used TensorFlow to write an AI which would decide whether to hold a security or not but, unsurprisingly, it was not particularly accurate. 

**HM Treasury** (Apr 2017 - Nov 2017)    
*Policy Adviser*
- My role was in the Financial Services group on EU strategy, responsible for Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories market access policy.
- I also project managed 12 cross-cutting work streams across the Financial Services group.

**Universit√§t Stuttgart** (Jun 2015 - Aug 2015)    
*Research Assistant*
- Recieved funding to work on an original problem related to the representation theory of orthogonal groups. Solved it by the end of my time in Stuttgart.
